      <item value="Set the width (in units of 1256th of a character width) The maximum column width for an individual cell is 255 characters. This value represents the number of characters that can be displayed in a cell that is formatted with the standard font (first font in the workbook). Character width is defined as the maximum digit width of the numbers 0, 1, 2, ... 9 as rendered using the default font (first font in the workbook). Unless you are using a very special font, the default character is '0' (zero), this is true for Arial (default font font in HSSF) and Calibri (default font in XSSF) Please note, that the width set by this method includes 4 pixels of margin padding (two on each side), plus 1 pixel padding for the gridlines (Section 3.3.1.12 of the OOXML spec). This results is a slightly less value of visible characters than passed to this method (approx. 12 of a character). To compute the actual number of visible characters, Excel uses the following formula (Section 3.3.1.12 of the OOXML spec): width = Truncate([{Number of Visible Characters} {Maximum Digit Width} + {5 pixel padding}]{Maximum Digit Width}256)256 Using the Calibri font as an example, the maximum digit width of 11 point font size is 7 pixels (at 96 dpi). If you set a column width to be eight characters wide, e.g. setColumnWidth(columnIndex, 8256), then the actual value of visible characters (the value shown in Excel) is derived from the following equation: Truncate([numChars7+5]7256)256 = 8; which gives 7.29. Params: columnIndex – - the column to set (0-based) width – - the width in units of 1256th of a character width Throws:" />
